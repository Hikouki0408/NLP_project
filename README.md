## PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It gained popularity for its dynamic computation graph, which allows for more flexible and intuitive model building. PyTorch uses a technique called "eager execution," which means that operations are executed as they are called, making it easier to debug and experiment with different model architectures.

## TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by the Google Brain team. It initially gained popularity for its static computation graph, which allowed for optimization and deployment of models on a wide range of hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units).


## Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning:

Project Description: Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as determining whether a movie review is positive or negative. You can build a sentiment analysis model using PyTorch that takes in text input and predicts the sentiment associated with it.

Steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing labeled text samples along with their corresponding sentiments (positive, negative, neutral, etc.). Datasets like IMDb Movie Reviews, Twitter Sentiment Analysis, or Amazon Product Reviews are popular choices.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and converting words to numerical representations. You might use techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent words as dense vectors.

3. Model Architecture: Design a deep learning model for sentiment analysis. A common approach is to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer-based architectures like BERT. You can use pre-trained embeddings or train them from scratch.

4. Model Implementation: Use PyTorch to implement the chosen model architecture. You'll need to define the layers, loss function, and optimization strategy.

5. Training: Split your dataset into training and validation sets. Train your model on the training set and validate it on the validation set. Monitor metrics like accuracy, loss, and F1-score to track the model's performance.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and network architecture to find the best combination that optimizes your model's performance.

7. Evaluation: Once your model is trained, evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness.

8. Deployment: Deploy your model as a simple web app or API where users can input text, and the model predicts the sentiment. You can use frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for this purpose.

## Datasets
 <h3>Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets</h3>
Context:

This is the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api . The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment.

Content:

It contains the following 6 fields:

1. target: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)

2. ids: The id of the tweet ( 2087)

3. date: the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)

4. flag: The query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.

5. user: the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)

6. text: the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)

## Data Splitting
1. Training Set: There are 1,152,000 instances (tweets) in the training set. This set is used to train your sentiment analysis model. It's the largest set and contains the most data for training the model's parameters.

2. Validation Set: There are 128,000 instances (tweets) in the validation set. This set is used for tuning hyperparameters and monitoring the model's performance during training. It helps prevent overfitting by providing an independent dataset for assessing how well the model generalizes to new data.

3. Test Set: There are 320,000 instances (tweets) in the test set. This set is used to evaluate the final performance of your trained model. After your model is trained and its hyperparameters are tuned using the training and validation sets, you use the test set to assess how well the model performs on unseen data. This helps you estimate how well your model will perform in real-world scenarios.

- It's important to have distinct training, validation, and test sets to ensure a fair evaluation of your model's performance and to avoid data leakage (the model "knowing" the test data during training). The specific sizes of these sets can vary depending on factors like the size of your dataset and the complexity of your model. In your case, the sizes seem reasonable given the large size of the Sentiment140 dataset.
